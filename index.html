            Hello, I am currently a Senior at Oregon State University, majoring in Applied Computer Science specializing
            in Game and Simulation Programming with an expected graduation date of June 2021. This coursework has exposed
            myself to a variety of topics such as Object Oriented Programming, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Graphics,
            Vector Calculus, 3D Modeling and more. With this, I am seeking a career upon graduation that allows me to explore
            these interests.
          </p> <br>
          <p>
            Following my official coursework, I am also a member of the Video Game Development Club at Oregon State University, specializing
            in Gameplay Mechanics. During this club, I work with approxiametly 20 other students seeking to produce full scale games using Unity 3D.
            My specific duties are broad, often ranging from character movement and interaction to even procedualry generated maps.
            Aside from this, I am also currently working on an individual project involving Virtual Reality. This project, Undead Blade,
            is a wave based Zombie game with a focus on melee combat. I expect this game to be completed and made available to the
            public later this year with future updates to be posted here.
          </p> <br>
          <p>
            Throughout my recent work I have developed a strong interest in projects involving 3D development whether it be working with games
            or specific graphics programming using software such as openGL. Due to this, I am currently seeking a career in a field similar
            to this that I can join upon my graduation.
          </p> <br>
          <p>
            For any more information, feel free to contact me and check out some examples of my work
            which I have added to this site. Also, below I have attached my formal resume providing more information
            about my qualifications.
