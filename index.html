            Hello, I am a third-year undergraduate at Oregon State University, majoring in
            Computer Science Engineering with an applied option in Simulation & Game programming.
            I am currently in search of an internship over the summer of 2020! I believe this would
            allow myself to gain real world knowledge in programming while also being given the
            opportunity to contribute to a like minded team.
          </p> <br>
          <p>
            I am currently a member of Oregon State Video Game Development Club where as a team of
            approxiametly 20-30 students, we each contribute in the production of full scale games
            using Unity3d. Although we have many teams ranging from Arts & Assets to Networking, I am a member
            of our gameplay mechanics team where we are currently developing items such as maps, gamemodes, spawing locations,
            and more, all of which contributed to our current game in development known as "Local War", which is a first-person-shooter.
            Upon further development and its final realease, it will be uploaded to this page and be made available on Steam.
            Aside from that, I am also working on vaious individuals games with a current focus on Virtual Reality.
          </p> <br>
          <p>
            Although video game development is my true passion, I have a strong desire for general programming
            and would be grateful for any opportunity given to better test my skills and become more well rounded.
            My current coursework consists of Software Engineering 2, Operating Systems, Computer Networks, and Artificial Intelligence.
            I believe these as well as classes taken prior will prepare me to greatly contribute to any internship in this field!
          </p> <br>
          <p>
            For any more information, feel free to contact me and check out some examples of my work
            which I have added to this site. Also, below I have attached my Resume providing more information
            about my qualifications.
